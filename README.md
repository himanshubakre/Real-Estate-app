Developed a full-stack real estate application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with additional features like real-time chat functionality using Socket.io is a robust undertaking. Here's a breakdown of how you might approach it:

    Backend Development (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB with Prisma):
        Set up your Node.js environment.
        Use Express.js for building the RESTful API endpoints.
        Integrate MongoDB for your database needs, and utilize Prisma as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database interactions.
        Implement authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
        Handle user sessions and authentication tokens securely using cookies.
        Set up WebSocket communication with Socket.io for real-time chat functionality.

    Frontend Development (React.js):
        Set up your React.js environment.
        Utilize React Router DOM for client-side routing to navigate between different views of your application.
        Implement Context API for managing global state and sharing data between components.
        Design and develop the user interface for your real estate application, including features like property listings, user profiles, and a chat interface.
        Integrate real-time chat functionality using Socket.io on the client-side.
